# Movies App #

This App was a graduation project from the [Mobile App Launchpad](https://www.mobileapplaunchpad.com.eg) that was held last year in Egypt by Google.

It lists movies with sort options (popular, top rated, and favorite), and date filter.

*you can download the apk from* [here](https://github.com/AhmedNMahran/MoviesApp/blob/master/app/app-release.apk)

### The Movie DB ###

* this app uses [the movie db](developers.themoviedb.org) api
* to use the project, you have to get an API key from [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup&sa=D&ust=1490041840568000&usg=AFQjCNHtIQ6fGeiNGirKumziPjf64jAYoA), then put it in app/build.gradle 
```
#!gradle

buildConfigField "String", "API_KEY", "\"Place the key here\""
```
### App Design? ###

The App is designed for mobile and tablet, so try to use it on both devices to experience the difference ;)
